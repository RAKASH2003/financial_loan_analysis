## Features / Highlights

### Business Problem
A financial institution needs an efficient way to monitor the massive volume of incoming loan applications and track the quality of its loan portfolio. Key challenges include quickly identifying growth drivers, spotting regional or purpose-based performance variations, and accurately quantifying the financial impact of 'Bad Loans' (severely delinquent or charged off).

### Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
1.  **Monitor Loan Volume and Financials:** Track key metrics like applications, funded/received amounts, and average rates over time.
2.  **Assess Portfolio Health:** Clearly segment and quantify the good and bad loans issued.
3.  **Analyze Demographic/Loan Trends:** Understand which states, terms, purposes, and employee experience levels are driving application volume and loan performance.
